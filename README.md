# indoor-rover-energy-payback-calculator
This calculator aims to give an approximation for how long would it take for an indoor rover to payback energy to its owner. It makes the assumption that owner bought the rover for a certain price.

Given this price, and a set of monthly transportation operations (which includes data for weight carried by the rover, frequency of operation (e.g. 5 times a month), distance ridden during the operation), it estimates how long would it take for the rover to complete its energy payback to its owner, in months.

A real world application of this calculator can be seen at [Gocheni Platform](https://www.gocheni.com/utilities/updates_and_announcements/)
